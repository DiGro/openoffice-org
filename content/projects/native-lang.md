## ![NL globe image][1] OpenOffice in Native Languages

The Native Language websites offer information, resources, and much
more in a user's native language.

We rely exclusively on volunteers to provide native language releases
of Apache OpenOffice. We can always use more help even for languages
where we already have maintainers. Please visit the [Native Language
Information][2] area of the Apache OpenOffice project to find out more about native
language support specifically, and please see [Getting Involved][3] for additional
information on getting involved in Apache OpenOffice.

Please see:

- [The download page][5] for a list of officially released languages.
- [Pootle][6] for an overview of the current localization status.
- [The OpenOffice source code][7] for a full list of available languages, including
  those that are not yet on Pootle and those for which we have no website
  available (for example, many of the African localizations are not
  listed below).

In the following table, the status definitions for the Website column are:

Status			| Explanation
----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
maintained		| This web site is localized and current, and the download links are localized and working.
help wanted		| This website needs help and may be incomplete, outdated or unmaintained. If you can help, please e-mail the [localization mailing list][9] saying that you can volunteer for updating a specific website translation.

  <h2>Apache OpenOffice Security Alerts</h2>

  <p>The Apache OpenOffice Security Team publishes details of security
  vulnerabilities in our <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/security/bulletin.html">Security
  Bulletin</a>.</p>

  <p>We also publish these alerts via the project's announcement list, <em>announce</em>.</p>

  <p>If you would like to subscribe to the list, please send a blank email to
  <a href=
  "mailto:announce-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">announce-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org</a>.
  You will be sent an email from instructions how to confirm your
  subscription. Once you have confirmed your subscription, you will receive
  any future emails from announce until you
  unsubscribe.</p>

  <p>Please note that the mailing list is fully automated, so if you use
  spam-filtering software, please make sure it will accept emails from
  <em>announce@openoffice.apache.org</em> <u>before</u> you try and
  subscribe.</p>

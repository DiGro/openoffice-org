  <h3> Manifest-processing errors in Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0 
  </h3>

    <ul>   
    
        <h4>Severity: Important</h4>

        <h4>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</h4>
        
        <h4>Versions Affected:</h4>
                                 <ul>
                                     <li>Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0, all languages, 
                                         all platforms.</li>
                                     <li>Earlier versions of OpenOffice.org may 
                                         be also affected.</li>
                                 </ul>
            

<h4>Description:</h4>
<p> Description: When OpenOffice reads an ODF document, it first loads and 
    processes an XML stream within the file called the manifest.  Apache 
    OpenOffice 3.4.0 has logic errors that allows a carefully crafted manifest 
    to cause reads and writes beyond allocated buffers.</p>
        <p>
        No specific exploit has been demonstrated 
    in this case, though such flaws generally are conducive to exploitation, 
    possibly including denial of service and elevation of privilege.
    </p> 

        <h4>Mitigation</h4>
        <p>OpenOffice users are advised to <a 
href="https://www.openoffice.org/download">upgrade to Apache OpenOffice 
3.4.1</a>. Users who are unable 
to upgrade immediately should exercise caution when opening untrusted ODF 
documents.</p>

<h4>Credits</h4>

<p>The Apache OpenOffice Security Team acknowledges Timo Warns of PRESENSE 
    Technologies GmbH as the discoverer of these flaws.</p>

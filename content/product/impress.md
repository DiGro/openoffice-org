*Impress your audience with your presentations!*

**Impress** is a truly outstanding tool for creating effective multimedia
presentations. Your presentations will stand out with 2D and 3D clip art,
special effects, animation, and high-impact drawing tools.

*Master Pages* simplify the task of preparing your materials. Save even more
time by [downloading templates][1] from our Templates repository.

*Complete range of Views* are supported: Slides / Outline / Notes / Handouts
to meet all the needs of presenters and audiences, plus an optional
multi-pane view to put all the tools at your fingertips.

*Multiple monitors support* so that presenters can have additional materials or notes while presenting their slides on a projector. 
Make the most of this with the integrated [Presenter Screen][2], which lets you see your next slides
as well as the time and the speaker notes.

*Easy-to-use drawing and diagramming tools* - a complete range to spice up your presentation. 'Park' your most commonly used drawing
tools around your screen ready for single-click access.

*Slide show Animation and Effects* bring your presentation to life. Fontworks
provides stunning 2D and 3D images from text. Create lifelike 3D images with
astounding speed and response.

*.odp Standard* - Save your presentations in OpenDocument format, the new international standard
for office documents. This XML based format means you're not tied up with using
Impress. You can access your presentations from any OpenDocument compliant
software.

*.ppt &amp; .pptx support* - Of course, you are free to import your old Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or
save your work in PowerPoint format for sending to people who are still using Microsoft products. 

*Flash .swf support* - Alternatively, use Impress's built-in ability to create Flash versions of your presentations.

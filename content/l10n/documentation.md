Documentation is stored in different places, due to historical reasons, but also
due to responsibilities. Some of the documentation are more static and often
accessible as WEB pages, whereas user supplied dynamic information are stored
in Wiki, finally day to day discussions are kept in a mailing list.

## Web pages

- [OpenOffice.org Documentation project][1]
- [Apache software foundation][2]
- [Bugzilla, error reporting system][3]

## Wiki pages

- [OpenOffice.org Wiki][4]
- [OpenOffice.org Wiki - Localization category][5]
- [Apache users openOffice.org Wiki][6]

## Mailing lists

We use mailing lists to communicate within the team. If you want to speak with
other project members, the best way is to join one of our mailing lists.

[Browse mailing list][7]

Subscribing to the list is easy, send an empty message to:
[L10N-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org][8]
The list where most of the communication takes place is
L10N@openoffice.apache.org. At the beginning, it's probably enough if you
join just this one. Later you can join some other as needed.

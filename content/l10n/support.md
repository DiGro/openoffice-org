We are a community of volunteers with all advantages and disadvantages.
We do not have a formal support organisation like the companies, but we
are highly motivated volunteers that often reply faster!

There are different kind of support for different needs. Several group
like developers and marketing have their own mailing lists. For localization
there is a special mailing list, you can join to ask questions direct,
and read the latest information, just sent an empty e-mail to:

[Sign up for localization mailing list][1]

You can also send a mail direct without joining the maillist:

[Send question to l10n mailling list][2]

**WARNING** if you do not subscribe you might miss answers!

Further we have collected a "frequently asked questions" to help especially
new volunteers.

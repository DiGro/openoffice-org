## Being a volunteer

All volunteers are different, people with different skills and
different levels of commitment/time to spare. This site is dedicated to people
interested in localization. For other possibilities please
see: [Apache OpenOffice site][1]

You can become a member of the l10n project by first:
[Sign up for localization mailing list][2] then present yourself and what you would like to do on: [mail list][3] and we
will give you more information, and help. Please remember no help is too small!
We maintain a list of [volunteers][4] where you can sign up just click on
"Sign Up" top right to create an account. Then you will be able to edit
the page.
The native language files are [here][5], get your language in the form of a
tar.bz2 archive. You will need to uncompress the archive: you can
use [7-Zip][6] to do so. It contains 276 files in many directories,
but you only need to work on those that have changed. You will need to open all of them
(and edit if needed) with [POEdit][7]; try this step and then we will be
available to help you again if needed. **Remark** please mark your
changes fuzzy (the cloud symbol), that makes it easier to review.

You may want to share work with other volunteers in your
language area. In that case, make absolutely sure that either you
coordinate by private e-mails or you send an e-mail to L10N
saying something like "I'll translate all files in the folders
from 'accessibility' to 'framework'".

**note**: after you open the first file with POEdit, you might
want to read [advice][8]. And for any doubts, just write L10N
and we'll be happy to assist!

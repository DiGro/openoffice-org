The localization project provides tools, workflows and a common discussion
place dedicated to the l10n process (see what Wikipedia [says][1]).
This project is mainly aimed at native language teams or single volunteers,
and contains all you need to successfully participate in making AOO appear
in your language.

If you want to help make apache open office available free in your language,
however small, this is the place to start.

Status on translations:

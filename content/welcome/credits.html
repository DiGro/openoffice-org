<h2>Apache OpenOffice Credits</h2>
<p>OpenOffice is developed by a large community of volunteers who do the coding, testing, translation, documentation, support and many other project functions.<br>
   The <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Directory+of+Volunteers">Directory of Volunteers</a> page gives credit to the many individuals
   who make OpenOffice possible.
</p>

 <p>Current Project Committers are listed on this <a href="https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#openoffice">Apache page</a>.</p> 
	
 <p>We also have a large cumulative list of <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/welcome/credits-ooo33.html">legacy contributors</a> to OpenOffice.org 3.3.0 and before.</p>

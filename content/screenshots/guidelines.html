<h2>Screenshots Guidelines</h2>
<p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to help us out gathering some good screenshots of OpenOffice.org in action.</p>
<p>We are looking for different type of screenshots - first of all, we want to show off the multi-platform aspect of
OpenOffice.org, so please send us screenshots of OpenOffice.org from as many different platforms as possible.
Also, we want to demonstrate both how OpenOffice.org is unique in its own right, and
show its own capabilities, as well
as some familiar features from other office suites - to show that it is not difficult
to switch.</p>
<p>
If it is possible, we would be really happy if you can send the images in PNG format, and with a size of 1024x768 pixels
or larger.</p>
You can mail links to <a href="mailto:dev@website.OpenOffice.org">dev@website.OpenOffice.org</a>
<p>
Please make sure that you are in compliance with intellectual property regulations.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping spread the word on OpenOffice.org!.</p>

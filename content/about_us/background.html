<b>Background</b>

<p>StarDivision, the original author of StarOffice, was founded in Germany
in the mid-1980s. It was acquired by Sun Microsystems during the summer
of 1999 and StarOffice 5.2 was released during June of 2000. Future
versions of StarOffice, beginning with 6.0, will be built using the
OpenOffice sources, APIs, file formats, and reference implementation.

<p>The OpenOffice.org technology will include using GTK+ from the current
VCL widgets and the component model will be unified with the Bonobo
component system. OpenOffice.org will deliver separate
applications/components which allow integration into platform user
environments.

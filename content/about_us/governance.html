<h2>Governance</h2><BR><BR>

<p>OpenOffice.org will be governed by the OpenOffice.org Foundation, which initially will be modeled on the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>. The OpenOffice.org Foundation's board will consist of members from the open source community, the OpenOffice.org community, and commercial vendors, with Sun Microsystems as an equal member. 

<P>The OpenOffice.org Project has wide support among the open source community. The project is being publicly endorsed by community leaders such as Andy Hertzfeld, Miguel de Icaza, Tim O'Reilly, and Brian Behlendorf. See the <a href="http://../press/sun_release.html">OpenOffice.org press release for more information.

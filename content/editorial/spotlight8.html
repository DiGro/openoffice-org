<p><b>Whiteboard Projects</b></p>
<p>In our general-interest <a href="//www-discuss/current/">discuss 
  forum</a>, discussion has been intense and very productive. As subscribers to 
  the "<a href="//www-announce/" target="_blank">announce</a>" 
  list will know, the community has just added new <a href="http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/index.html" target="_blank">Whiteboard</a> 
  projects. To a substantial degree, these were born in the discuss list. Interested 
  readers, curious about how an Open Source community creates new projects might 
  wish to visit the <a href="//www-discuss/current/msg03477.html" target="_blank">initiating 
  message for the Groupware project</a>. But they shouldn't stop there; indeed, 
  following the thread is fascinating. And, while there, if you wish to trace

<h4>Operating Systems</h4>
<p> What operating system do you use? OpenOffice.org runs on 
                    Windows, Linux, Solaris and is being ported to Mac OS X; no 
                    other office suite is so capable. In the last ten days, discussions 
                    on the general &quot;<a href="//servlets/BrowseList?listName=discuss&by=date&from=2001-11-01&to=2001-11-30&count=1&first=602">discuss</a>&quot; 
                    list have touched on two, related issues, expressed by the 
                    subject lines of the mail threads, &quot;<a href="//servlets/BrowseList?listName=discuss&by=thread&from=4427">Are 
                    we freeing MS Windows</a>,&quot; and &quot;<a href="//servlets/BrowseList?listName=discuss&by=thread&from=4326">Transition 
                    Stories, Win to Lin.</a>&quot; The idea behind both is to 
                    examine what is meant, in practice and theory, by supporting 
                    and contributing an Open Source project such as OpenOffice.org. </p>

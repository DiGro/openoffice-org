<h2>Spotlight: On Developers and Technology</h2>
<br>


On "Project Merge." The proposal, made 
      by Martin Gallwey in the <a href="//www-discuss/current/" target="_blank">discuss 
      forum</a> two weeks ago, initiated one of the more vigorous debates OpenOffice.org 
      has seen in months. Martin's <a href="//www-discuss/current/msg03975.html" target="_blank">simple 
      proposal</a> was to merge several related mailing lists into one. This way, 
      members would be able to discuss similar topics in one list and not miss 
      out on relevant discussions taking place in other lists. Discussion on the 
      topic has been technically sophisticated and also important. For, an Open 
      Source project lives in its mailing lists, and determining the right mix 
      of size and constitution is a difficult art. The <a href="//www-discuss/current/thrd26.html#03833" target="_blank">thread</a> 
      of the discussions is recommended reading for anyone interested in seeing 
      how an Open Source project negotiates its own success.

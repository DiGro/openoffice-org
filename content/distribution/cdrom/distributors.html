	<h2>Concerning the legacy Distribution Project</h2>

	<p>The Apache OpenOffice project distributes OpenOffice online, as a free download <a href="http://download.openoffice.org">from our website</a>.  Although 
this is sufficient for most users, we also known that for others users, a copy of OpenOffice on CD-ROM or other media is preferred.</p>

<p>
The legacy OpenOffice.org project had a &quot;Distribution Project&quot; that listed the contact information for 3rd parties who would provide, at a charge, a CD-ROM containing
OpenOffice. We've suspended this program, until the Apache OpenOffice project determines how a similar service might be enabled in the future, one that will give 
users greater assurance that they are receiving the latest version of OpenOffice.

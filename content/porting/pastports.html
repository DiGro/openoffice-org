<h1>Past Port</h1>
Past ports here means that a port to a specific platform has been started
before on OpenOffice.org. That means that there may be some source code to
support that platform in the source tree.  The code may still support for
these platforms, but there is no ongoing testing and possibly direct support
for the build environment or even download of installation set available.<br>
<br>
Any person interested in taking up those ports will get support of the community
so don't let that deter you from taking a port on.<br>
<br>

for the exact status of any platform.<br>

**Base** is a fully featured desktop database management system, designed to
meet the needs of a broad array of users, from tracking a personal CD collections, 
to producing a corporate monthly departmental sales reports.

Base offers wizards to help users new to database design (or Base) 
to create Tables, Queries, Forms and Reports, along with a set of
predefined table definitions for tracking Assets, Customers, Sales Orders,
Invoices and much more.

When a personal use database is all you need, Base offers the full HSQL
relational database engine, configured for single user, with the data stored
right in the Base file, as well as native support for dBase flat files.

For power users in the enterprise, Base delivers native support drivers for
a variety of multi-user database engines: MySQL, Adabas D, MS Access and
PostgreSQL. In addition, support for JDBC and ODBC standard drivers allows you
to connect to virtually any database.

Base integrates seamlessly into the rest of the Apache OpenOffice suite
applications, for example:

  - Supplying address book data for mail merge in Writer using the industry
    standard LDAP protocol, or common address book formats such as Microsoft
    Outlook, Microsoft Windows and Mozilla; 
  - Creating linked data ranges in Calc files for data pilot analysis or as the 
    basis for charts.

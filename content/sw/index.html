<P>This is the home of the Apache OpenOffice Word Processing Project.
Its heart is the “Writer” application but it also comprises the
Apache OpenOffice Formula Editor “Math”, the integration of the
linguistic components (spell checker, hyphenator, thesaurus) and some
document filters for formats of other word processors. The linguistic
components themselves are part of the <A HREF="https://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/">lingucomponent</A>
project.

*Simple to create equations and formulae for your documents!*

Math is Apache OpenOffice's component for mathematical equations. It is most
commonly used as an equation editor for text documents, but it can also be used
with other types of documents or stand-alone. When used inside Writer, the
equation is treated as an object inside the text document. Similarly, one can
also insert these into other Apache OpenOffice programs like [Calc][1] and
[Impress][2].

Using Math, there are three main ways of entering a formula:

- Type markup in the equation editor.
- Right-click on the equation editor and select the symbol from the context menu.
- Select a symbol from the *Elements* toolbox.

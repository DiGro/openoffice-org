<P><B>Preface</B>

<p>
The purpose of this paper is to provide a strategic overview of the OpenOffice.org
project. It is designed to deliver an introduction to the details of the principles and
mechanisms involved in the operation project. Having a good understanding of
these principles and mechanisms is key for anyone interested in becoming involved
in the OpenOffice.org project.</p>
<p>It is expected that as the OpenOffice.org project matures, some of these details will
evolve. This document will be updated periodically to reflect the nature of these
changes to the strategies of the OpenOffice.org project.</p>

## OOo 3.1 Reviews

  - [The 10 Coolest Open-Source Products Of 2009][3.1.a]
    23 Dec 2009, **ChannelWeb**:

    *(One hundred million downloads is) a telling example of the popularity of
    the open source alternative to Microsoft Office and its continued
    advancements in features and functionality.*

  - [Open source software: An all-star lineup][3.1.b]
    By Luc Feys Fri, 25 Sep 2009, **Earth Times**:

    *No surprise here: OpenOffice is the undisputed king of open source office
    software. Boasting most of what you get with the big commercial packages -
    a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation application - the individual
    applications in OpenOffice are even compatible with the file formats used
    by MS Office and other leading fee-based software.*

  - [OpenOffice 3.1 deep dive][3.1.c]
    By Simon Jones 12 Aug 2009, **PC Pro**:

    *OpenOffice.org has recently released version 3.1 of its eponymous 
    software suite, a minor upgrade that brings some welcome features and some
    much needed polish to the nearest thing Microsoft Office has to a
    competitor.*

  - [Microsoft feels pressure for 'free' software][3.1.d]
    By James Derk July 15, 2009, **The Star Press**:

    *Anyone can download OpenOffice today for free at openoffice.org. The
    open-source site offers a full-featured Office suite for nothing: no
    advertising support, no nothing. Just download it, install it and go. Some
    colleges and businesses have already moved to OpenOffice to save money, and
    I expect others to give it a look.*

  - [OpenOffice.org 3.1: Better Performance][3.1.e]
    By Jason Brooks 18-05-2009, **eWeek**:

    *The 3.0 release of OpenOffice left some issues in the productivity suite.
    This new version makes a good job of fixing them*

  - [OpenOffice.org 3.1: The next generation][3.1.f]
    By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, May 11 2009, **Computerworld**:

    *The latest version of the open-source office suite OpenOffice.org 3.1
    has just arrived, and it's a good one. While some of the improvements are
    visible to the naked eye, I found that the most important changes were
    hidden under the hood.*

  - [OpenOffice 3.1 ready to lick Microsoft's suite?][3.1.g]
    By Scott Gilbertson, 11th May, 2009 04:14 GMT, **The Register**:

    *OpenOffice.org remains the most popular open source answer to
    Microsoft's ubiquitous Office suite, and in these recessionary times, the 
    appeal of "free" software is stronger than ever.*

  - [OpenOffice 3.1 goes to bat against Office 2007 SP2][3.1.h]
    By Angela Gunn, May 13, 2009, 10:33 AM, **betanews**:

    suite a necessary download.*

## OOo 3.0 Reviews

  - [OpenOffice 3.0 a fresh blow for Microsft][3.0.a]
    By Adam Turner November 25, 2008, **The Sydney Morning Herald**:

    *If you're spending a fortune on MS Office licenses, you should at least be
    evaluating OpenOffice to see if it meets the needs of your basic users, if
    not your power users. Microsoft Office still has a place in many
    organisations, but OpenOffice 3.0 is a viable alternative for many people.*

  - [OpenOffice.org 3.0][3.0.b]
    Full Review by Edward Mendelson, **PC Magazine**:

    *But for the first time, I'm ready to recommend this new version as a viable
    alternative to Microsoft's offering. It still has rough edges, but it has an
    impressive feature set, a generally lucid interface, pure open-source
    credentials, and - in the current economic climate - the decisive advantage
    of being absolutely free.*

  - [OpenOffice offers end run around Microsoft][3.0.c]
    By René A. Guzman - Express-News Web Posted: 10/17/2008 12:00 CDT,
    **My San Antonio Life**:

    *In these tough economic times, it's nice to know you can still get quality
    for free. Take OpenOffice.org 3, the new office suite sure to give Microsoft
    nothing but further grief.*

  - [Review: OpenOffice.org 3.0][3.0.d]
    By Dave Bailey, 24 Oct 2008, **vnunet.com**:

    *Version 3.0 of OpenOffice.org does add significant new features, and since
    in these financially turbulent times it costs nothing to install, it could
    reduce bottom line expenditure significantly if deployed extensively. We
    experienced few problems with the suite that couldn't be circumvented with
    workarounds. We think system administrators should give it a close look,
    especially if they're rolling out thousands of minimally used copies of
    Microsoft Office with only features like basic formatting, spell checking,
    and word count really being needed.*

  - [OpenOffice 3: Faster, uninspired interface][3.0.e]
    Posted by Seth Rosenblatt, October 13, 2008 4:59 PM PDT, **CNET Download**:

    *After using OpenOffice's MS Word analog, Writer, all day, I can confirm
    that this update is worth it for the improvement in response and load times,
    if nothing else. The installation is still enormous, with an installer about
    130MB for Windows users and 160MB for Mac, but the installation process
    is smoother. From start to finish, it clocked in at around 5 minutes,
    significantly faster than installing OpenOffice 2. People who use OpenOffice
    as their primary productivity suite should take advantage of the OpenOffice
    Quickstarter, which noticeably accelerates program launch times and has been
    made even faster in version 3.*

  - [The LXF Test: OpenOffice.org 3.0][3.0.f]
    Monday, October 13, 2008 - 11:59 AM - Posted by M-Saunders,
    **Linux Format**:

    *Overall, does OpenOffice.org 3.0 provide a step forward? Yes, with extra
    features and some performance improvements at startup, although in use it
    still feels sluggish and clunky in places. Does it justify the jump in major
    version number? We're not convinced, but the 2.x series has been around for
    a while and this release does present a fresh face, and more scope for
    extensions with the internal changes. On balance, the new OpenOffice.org
    release is a step forward, and if they can speed it up a bit for 3.1 we'll
    be more than happy.*

  - [Treat yourself to a suite alternative: OpenOffice.org 3.0][3.0.g]
    October 12, 1:30 PM by Jason Brooks, **S.F. Technology Examiner**:

    *OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a great suite of office productivity applications
    (word processor, spreadsheet, presentation and database) that's very similar
    to Microsoft Office in function, and very different in price. Where pricing
    for Microsoft Office 2007 starts around $100, you can download and use
    OpenOffice.org 3.0 for free.*

  - [OpenOffice 3.0 is available now][3.0.h]
    Monday, 13 October 2008 Jonny Evans, **Macworld**:

    *Microsoft faces serious challenge as well-featured free productivity
    software ships. After three years development OpenOffice.org has introduced
    OpenOffice 3.0, the most advanced version yet of its completely free
    Microsoft Office competitor*

  - [OpenOffice 3.0 is out][3.0.i]
    Sunday, 12 October 2008, 12:58 PM By Charlie Demerjian, **The Inquirer**:

    *Overall, OpenOffice 3.0 seems like a great step forward, and for the low
    low price of free, how can you complain? Grab a copy and have at thee, it is
    everything you could need in an office pack without the $500 price tag,
    ever-changing UI, and forced file formats that people don't want.*

  - [OpenOffice.org 3.0 Reviewed][3.0.j]
    13 October 2008, 10:32 Dj Walker-Morgan, **Heise Open Source UK**:

    *OpenOffice.org is ... a reasonably competent office productivity suite for
    a large number of users and the various extensions, including the new Import
    PDF Extension for 3.0, mean it can be, at least, sufficient for many tasks.*

## OOo 3.0 Pre-Release Reviews

  - [OpenOffice.org Grows Up][3.0.pre.a]
    By Jason Brooks, 2008-10-02, **eWeek.com**:

    *Nine years after Sun Microsystems bought StarOffice, the resulting
    OpenOffice.org project is ready to roll out its 3.0 release. Enhanced format
    compatibility and features put it on par with Microsoft Office.*

  - [OpenOffice 3: a preview][3.0.pre.b]
    By Prashant Rao, **Express India**:

    *OpenOffice is free, and for organizations that want to stay legal and yet
    provide an office suite to all their workers. it is an excellent solution.
    A mixed environment with power users on Office 2007 and the rest on
    OpenOffice works well, as some of India’s biggest banks and BPO outfits have
    found out to their advantage.*

## OOo 2 Reviews

  - **PC Pro Magazine** delivers its verdict on Version 2:

    *Our pick of the low-cost office suites has had a much-needed overhaul, and
    now battles Microsoft in terms of features, not just price.*

    OpenOffice.org 2 earns ![Six stars](/product/pix/6stars.gif) in 
    [Issue 135, Jan 06][pcpro]. The magazine's reviewer concludes:

    *OpenOffice certainly doesn't lack features compared to the market leader,
    and most of its ease-of-use issues stem from people's familiarity with
    Microsoft Office rather than an inherent problem with the program itself.
    As such, you should certainly try OpenOffice's offering before donating
    another UKP100 or more to Microsoft's coffers. After all, it's free.*

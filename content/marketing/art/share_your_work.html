<div>This should contain short licensing informations (linked to the present licensing page) and links: <br />
- Create an OOo account
<br />
- a table with links to the responsible issue for every gallery (some need to be created beforehand) <br />
- a table with the other relevant issues for the project (this list should be reduced as far as possible) <br />
- a link that creates a new issue
<br />
<br />
The page will have to explain how to submit an issue, attach the artwork to it and so on...

<h3>Sorry - There is no Official Artwork in this Category</h3>

<br />

We are really sorry, but up to now the OpenOffice.org Art Project didn't approve any artwork as 
Official Artwork in this category.
 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />
As artwork is placed in the Additional Artwork Gallery first, there might be something you're
looking for over there:
<br />
<p align="center">
<a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Art/Gallery"
<img src="../images/additional_button_large.png" border=none style="padding-bottom:0.8em" alt="Additional Artwork Gallery"></img>
</a>
</p>
<br />
<br />

Please fell free to join our mailing list art@marketing.openoffice.org 
and ask your question there, if the Additional Gallery and the Wiki can't help you.

<br />

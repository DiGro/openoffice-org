Apache OpenOffice is more than a collection of six superb tools.

Unlike some competitors, this suite was not created from a collection of
separate pieces of software. From the start, it was designed as one complete
office package.

- All the packages have a similar "look and feel" making them very easy to use,
  with common "learn once use everywhere" tools like the Styles and Formatting.
  Apache OpenOffice takes its "look and feel" from your computer - if you change
  your desktop, Apache OpenOffice will change to match.

- The same tools are used consistently across the suite - for example, the tools
  you use to work with graphics within Writer are also found in Impress and Draw.

- You don't need to know which application was used to create a particular
  file - you can "File Open" any Apache OpenOffice file from anywhere and the
  correct application will be launched.

- All the packages share a common spell-checker, etc.; and if you change an
  "Option" in one package, it's changed in them all.

- Information can be transferred easily between all the packages.

- All the components save in OpenDocument format, the new international standard
  for office documents. This XML based format offers substantial disk savings
  compared to common competitors' formats. It also means you can access your
  data from any OpenDocument compliant software.

- All the packages are installed in one single operation, using the installation
  process you are used to on your computer.

- All the packages are released under the same open licensing model - there are
  no hidden charges now or in the future.

Everything you need in an office productivity suite - 
[get it today][1]!

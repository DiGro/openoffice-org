  - **You are using Microsoft Windows XP or Vista and Microsoft no longer supports Office on that platform**

  - **You need to be able to read older document formats**

  - **You are an desktop or laptop OEM and need a replacement for Microsoft's Office Starter Edition**

  - **You want a free office suite to provide to patrons in a library, a community center or an internet cafe**

  - **You use Microsoft Office at work but want to have something at home you can use occasionally**

  - **You need a replacement for Microsoft Office 2003 when it reaches End Of Life and support ends in 2014**
